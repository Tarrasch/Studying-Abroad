# Arash's courses abroad HT12

It should be revieved to see if the courses have valid counterparts.

## Course relations

Luckily MPALG offers much freedom in having a small set of must-take courses.
Some courses at the foreign universities have obvious counterparts in the
Chalmers MPALG course set. Other courses are in depth or more
practical versions of Chalmers courses, like the AI courses at
GA Tech.
