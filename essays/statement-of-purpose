The purpose of my application for exchange studies is twofold. First, I
want to fill in the gap of algorithmic courses I can't fill by taking
courses at my home university. Second, the experience of a new
country will be exciting and rewarding for me, both in the short and
long term.

Chalmers University of Technology is the university that I currently attend. It
is leading in many of my interest domains, like language technology and
functional programming. Though my hunger is not stilled with that, I would like
to use this opportunity to study at a university where algorithms is a featured
subject, particularly I noticed the flurry of algorithm courses that you have
(one course for randomized algorithms, one for graph algorithms, etc.).
Machine learning and artificial intelligence are two subjects that sing along
well with algorithms and that I find interesting, in both areas I too see that
you offer a multitude of courses. While I like my own University as well, it
doesn't include algorithms among it's strongest research areas. I hope this
gives a clear picture of why I choose the College of Computing at GA Tech.

To study abroad will contribute to my mental vitality, as putting myself
through this experience will nourish my independence.  I expect to mature and
improve my social skills and so forth, but most of all I want to have fun
studying and I'm looking forward upon befriending my classmates.  With this
attitude I feel certain that at the end of my studies I have the freedom to
either continue researching or to land a real job through my professional
network.
