I decided to attend my university immediately after high school. At that time I
was eager to start studying, with eagerness I studied hard and ultimately
achieved very good grades. To challenge myself I decided to study at an
accelerated pace and managed to do so successfully. With this ambition I became a
recognized face among the professors at my institution, that is why I with ease
collected my three reference persons.

For long I've always exercised my teaching skills, I've done this through
various university employments, the first being that I for one semester worked
as a Supplemental Instruction (SI) mentor in math courses. The other being that
I currently work as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in a CS course, as a TA I teach
in exercise sessions and grade exams.

As for extracurricular activities, I've been active in an array of the
university associations. Last year I participated in the hobby robotics
association and built a robot together with a friend. This year I've joined the
computer group, where I technically maintain the web services provided to
students in my department. Naturally I learn a lot from these activities, but
when I seek a more accustomed environment I often hang out with friends, play
chess or do sports.
